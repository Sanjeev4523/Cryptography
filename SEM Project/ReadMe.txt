This a demo of the proposed codebase for the project.

It has 2 examples:
    (1) example1.py
    - This examples takes the 10 day period Blood Pressure level of the patient
      in an encrypted form amd then returns the Mean Blood pressure to the doctor.

    - The 10 values can be changes at the line 21 of the code. I have not taken input because this is just a demo codebase.

    - run command : python example1.py


    (2) example2.py
    - This examples takes the normal patient form and encrypts the data 

    - Patient data can be changed at line 65

    - I have used cryptodome library for encrypted non-PID based data i.e firstname , lastname etc etc. directly taken froim examples in the cryptodome dome.

    - The data which requires processing is encrypted using Paillier encryption scheme
    
    - run command - python example2.py
